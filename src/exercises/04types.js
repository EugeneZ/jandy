// In JS, every value has a type. The types are:
// (NOTE: In these comments, I will use the backtick character ` to wrap "code"
// expressions. Don't actually type the backtick when you use them! The one
// exception to this is if you are using a "templated string" which is a topic
// we'll cover later. Don't worry about it for now.)
// The types:
// * boolean: `true` or `false`
// * null: `null`
// * undefined: `undefined`
// * number: `0`, `1`, `2`, `-1`, `-2`, `1.555` etc. Javascript doesn't
//   differentiate between integers and decimal numbers (called floating-point
//   numbers in computer-speak)
// * string: `'Hi'`, `"Hello"`, `''`, `""`, etc. Notice that an empty string is
//   a string. There's no difference between single quotes and double quotes
//   except that you can't use a single quote within a single-quoted string
//   without putting a backslash in front of it, and same for double quoted
//   strings.
// * object: `[1,2,3]`, `[""]`, `{a: 1}`, `{ b: true, c: null, d: [{}] }` Notice that
//   objects are complex because they are collections of other types of values,
//   including objects themselves. We'll worry about them later.

// Make the tests pass!
