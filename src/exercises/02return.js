// In JS, you can make a function that returns a value like this:
export function getZero() {
  return 0
}

// The test for the above sample is failing! Fix it.

// Then, fix the tests for the rest of failures. They are expecting a variety of
// return values. When you use the return statement, it means that your function
// will give a result. Most tests expect some sort of result, so you will be
// using the return statement a lot.
