// You can do math in JS. The supported operators are:
// +
// -
// / (that's a slash for division, don't confuse it with the comment slashes)
// * (multiplication)
// ** exponent (2**8 is 2 to the power of 8)
// % (modulo... that little guy? Don't worry about that little guy.)

// Also, you can use parentheses to control the order of operations. Remember
// your math classes!

// Make the tests pass.
